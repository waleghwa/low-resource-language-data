This repository is the result of work funded by the Lacuna Fund. We collected parallel corpora for Kiswahili and three indigenous Kenyan languages: Kidaw'ida, Kalenjin and Dholuo.
We also uploaded the indigenous language text data to Mozilla Common Voice and crowd-source voice data by having volunteers read the text data.
